        "1. You've seen a Particle Filter used for single object tracking\n",
        "2. You've seen that a Particle Filter can help deal with occlusions - i.e. in this example the object being tracked disappeared for a few frames and the Particle Filter continued to predict motion for it based on its model.\n",
        "3. You've seen that you probably need to tune the Filter to get it working for a particular application.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Next Steps\n",
        "1. We've seen a set of tracking filters, from the same 'Kalman' family.  Now, we'll look at how to track multiple objects in a scene and then we'll look at other tracking techiques not in the 'Kalman' family such as Optical Flow and CNN Feature based trackers."
