        "This is an implementation, by Z. Q. Pei of a multiple object tracking algorithm, namely DeepSORT. DeepSORT is basically the same as SORT but with an added CNN model to extract features in image of human part bounded by a detector. \n",
        "\n",
        "This CNN model is a RE-ID model and the detector used in the paper documenting it, by Wokje et al, is FasterRCNN, and the original source code for DeepSORT is linked below.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the original code, the CNN model was implemented in tensorflow, but Z. Q. Pei re-implemented the CNN feature extraction model with PyTorch and this is the code we're working with today. \n",
        "\n",
        "Also, Z. Q. Pei used YOLOv3 to generate bboxes instead of FasterRCNN.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's an interesting relatively recent approach, leading to the intuition that we can effectively have a relatively low cost tracker which uses feature vectors extracted from later layers of detectors as the basis of a cost-function to either enhance or replace a traditional Kalman Filter based tracking approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "See the video accompanying this lab for a review of recent CNN-based tracking approaches."

It may be interesting to review the original DeepSORT / SORT papers etc and determine if an approach that sends feature descriptors from late layers in detectors such as YOLOv3, SSD, FasterRCNN along with bounding boxes combined with a Hungarian/Kalman has been thoroughly explored already or if there's scope for novel work.\n",
